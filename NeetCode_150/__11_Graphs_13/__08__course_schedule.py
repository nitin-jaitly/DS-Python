Course Schedule
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [a, b] indicates that you must take course b first if you want to take course a.

The pair [0, 1], indicates that must take course 1 before taking course 0.

There are a total of numCourses courses you are required to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.

Return true if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[0,1]]

Output: true
Explanation: First take course 1 (no prerequisites) and then take course 0.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Output: false
Explanation: In order to take course 1 you must take course 0, and to take course 0 you must take course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 1000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 1000
All prerequisite pairs are unique.
